# README

Have not worked in Rails for years, Rails 3? probably 4. Ah, it was Rails 4 and a dabble in Rails 5.

Just fires up a new project, and used application controllers, with three different actions


* hello

* info - this is the landing page

* goodbye

Just use: http://127.0.0.1:3000/goodbye
